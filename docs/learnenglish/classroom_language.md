## 课前做准备

### 话题准备

#### 被动答

准备老师有可能要问的问题，帮助孩子先练习多种不同的回答，比如自我介绍，介绍自己，可以说的东西很多。

```
- 基本信息：姓名、年龄、家庭成员、在哪儿上学

- 有关家乡：在中国的哪个省、哪个市，这里有什么物产或者特色

- 有关个人爱好：自己喜欢干什么、吃什么

- 有关今天发生的一件事：今天跟爸爸妈妈一起去了动物园
```

具体问题详情可以参考 **warm-up** 部分，孩子可以着重准备一下。当孩子能够在一堂课的开头流利的自我介绍，首先得到的是老师的夸奖，同时也给与了孩子极大的成就感，而学习的持续性就需要源源不断的成就感或者鼓励。其次老师也会针对性的给与一些反馈，比如动物园里面都有什么，老师的家乡有这些嘛？此外，老师除了鼓励和反馈，还会提升教学预期，老师感受到孩子能够表达得丰富流畅，往往会不由自主地在授课过程中使用更复杂和丰富的语言，给孩子额外的补充，哪个老师不喜欢教好孩子呢？

**自我介绍范例**

My name is Li Ming, you can call me Tom。I'm 9 years old。I'm in class 1, grade 2\. I come from sichuan, China. I like reading and dancing.

#### 主动问

为了能跟老师在课堂上很好的互动，可以在课前准备两个感兴趣的话题问老师：

```
  - Oh, teacher. What kind of food do you like？

  - Is there any hot pot in the your country?

  - What's the difference between Philippine food and Chinese food?
```

为何要主动问老师呢，一节课是否能够上出最好的效果，和老师给的反馈有很大的关系。主动询问老师问题可以得到老师丰富的反馈信息，比如菲律宾和中国的食物差异，相当于输入的语料增加了很多。孩子接收的语料越丰富，自然学习效果越好。每节课多10句话，天长日久也不是小数。
