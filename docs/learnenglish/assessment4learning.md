# Key Principles of Assessment for Learning and Implementation Strategies

**Sharing learning goals/ objectives with pupils**

- Share learning objectives (Los) at the beginning of the lesson, and where appropriate during the lesson in language that pupil can understand.
- Use these objectives as the basis for questioning and feedback during the plenary.
- Evaluate this feedback in relation to achievement of the Los to inform next stages of planning

**Helping pupils to know and recognize the standards they are aiming for**

- Show pupils work which has met criteria, with explanation of why? Give pupils clear success criteria that relate to the learning objectives.
- Model what it should look like. For example, exemplify good writing on the board.
- Ensure that there are clear, shared expectations about the presentation of work.
- Provide displays of pupils’ work which show processes as well as finished product.

**Involving pupils in self assessment**

- Give pupils opportunities to talk about what they have learned, and what they have found difficult, using the learning objectives as a focus.
- Encourage pupils to work/discuss together focusing upon how to improve.
- Ask pupils to explain the steps in their thinking (how did you get that answer?)
- Give time for pupils to reflect upon their learning.
- Identify with pupils the next steps in learning.

**Providing feedback which leads to pupils recognizing their next steps and how to take them**

- Providing oral as well as written feedback whenever possible.
- Ensure feedback is constructive rather than simply positive, identifying what pupils has done well, what needs to be done to improve, and how to do it.
- Identify the next step for individuals and groups, as appropriate.

**Having confidence that every pupil can improve**

- Identify small steps to enable pupils to see their progress, thus building confidence and self-esteem.
- Encourage pupils to explain their thinking and reasoning within a secure classroom ethos.

**Involving both teacher and pupils in reviewing and reflecting on assessment information**

- Reflect with pupils on their work e.g.through storyboard of steps taken during an investigation.
- Choose tasks appropriately to provide quality assessment information(emphasis upon process, not just on the correct answer).
- Provide time for pupils to reflect upon what they have learned and understood, and to identify where they still have difficulties.
- Adjust planning, evaluate effectiveness of task, resources etc. as a result of assessment.
